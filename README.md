### Matlab Implementation of SigFuge (Significant Features Using Gene Expression)

This collection of Matlab functions provides an alternative implementation
to the R/Bioconductor package, `SigFuge`. Functionality and design of most
functions are meant to be equivalent to those in the R package. However,
the R/Bioconductor package should be assumed to be the more 'up-to-date'
and preferred implementation.

This package also includes various other functions for plotting expression curves
with splicing information. Functions are meant to work with .txt files including
per-base counts of aligned reads.

This package relies on several SigClust functions from the codebase of J.S. Marron,
